TODO
----
(things we did not get done in time / known bugs)

 - Add a "How to play"-screen and text in menu / add a tutorial
 - Do not create new obstacles on top of existing ones
 - keep order when switching spells
 - small animation that shows the wizards are save when they switched the spells
 
Additional stuff
----------------
(ideas how the game could be improved)

 - add more animations for the selected spell and the switch
 - Multiple level (different terrain)
 - collect ingredients for the spell or new spells (power ups?) on the map. 
 - move both wizards to the middle of the map to exchange the spells
   - add a fist bump-animation for the two wizards
