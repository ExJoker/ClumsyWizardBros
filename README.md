# Hangover: Magic Edition
About
-----
Game for the Global Game Jam 2018, developed in Bremen (see https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/hangover-magic-edition )

Description
-----------
The Clumsy Wizard Brothers gave a big house party to celebrate the harmony between the magical and the human world. For this occasion they made their favorite drink for everyone to enjoy. Unfortunately, not everyone handled it so well. The humans had the worst hangover in history and the orcs... well, they got aggressive and wanted more. But the Clumsy Brothers fear no evil. They are the only ones who can brew the potion to get everything back to normal! In order to reach the Wizard HQ and brew the potion two players need to play cooperatively and help the Clumsy Brothers to overcome various elemental obstacles. Since the Clumsy Brothers are extremely forgetful, they can only use spells when they have the right spell book. The players need to exchange their magic spells correctly so each brother has the right elemental spell to overcome the next obstacle. Don’t dawdle! The orcs are hot on your trail and will catch up if you are too slow. Also, better watch your step because the path is full of passed out humans and poisonous bushes. Bring both brothers safely to the Wizard HQ to save the day!
